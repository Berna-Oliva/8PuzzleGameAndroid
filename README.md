# 8PuzzleGameAndroid
This is an android version of the 8 puzzle game derived from my own school requirement which was initially written in Java for desktop. 

I used this project to learn about basic native android development using Kotlin and Android Studio. With this, I was able to learn the basic syntax of Kotlin as well as how to navigate through gradle, xml, and Android Studio to complete this personal project.
